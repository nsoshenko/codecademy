1. Add tracks to the playlist (critical) DONE
2. Bug with errors on reload when getting token (critical) DONE
3. Enter keystroke for search DONE

Potential Jammming Features:

Include preview samples for each track
Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
Add a loading screen while playlist is saving
Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search
After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect
Ensure playlist information doesnâ€™t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token
